# 2dLists Exercises: Goal: become familiar on how to iterate through 2 dimentional lists and solve problems.
# be aware of the index values of the loop, and the position in the 2d list.

#Q1 Create a 3 by 5 2dlist with the elements from 1 to 15 using a doouble for loop.

#Q2 add the elements in each row. print the sum. Add the sum to the end of each row.

#Q3 Add up the elements in each column. Pring the sum. Add the sum to the end of each column.
